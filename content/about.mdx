  Who we are and what we're building.

Archaic was founded on the vision of bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Our original flagship, the Archaic Marketplace, empowers physical artists by turning their works into 3D-scanned digital twins that can be minted and sold as NFTs. We expanded into Escave, a gamified mobile AR experience with daily riddles, object detection, and collectible 3D scans. Building on the same 3D tech, Artifakt enables brands to offer real-time 3D product customization online. Together, these ventures form the Archaic Verseâ€”a unified ecosystem where art, play, and commerce converge through immersive technology and blockchain-powered ownership.
