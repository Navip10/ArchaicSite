  Our roadmap to a unified ecosystem.

## The Loop

**Artists → Marketplace → 3D Assets → Players (Escave) → Brands (Artifakt) → Shared ownership/utility → Back to artists.**

- **Artists** scan physical pieces into **3D assets** and mint digital twins on the **Archaic Marketplace**.
- **Players** encounter those assets through **Escave** gameplay (AR riddles, object detection, collectibles).
- **Brands** integrate the same assets via **Artifakt** for real-time 3D customization in e-commerce.
- **Ownership & utility** flows back to **artists**, creating a network effect that powers the **Archaic Verse**.
